Special thanks to: 
* Jason Baumgartner for creating and maintaining pushshift.io, the ultimate reddit archive tool.
* Jesper Wrang for creating removeddit.com, a web app for viewing removed comments.

## Scenario:
So you're sitting on the toilet, taking care of business, and browsing reddit on your phone.

You come across a thread linking to an article with a __controversial__ headline. 

The article is breaking news and full of some _spicy_ text. 

Your legs are going numb since you've been on the toilet for half an hour, but that doesn't matter right now. 

You NEED to read the comments in the reddit thread, but you notice a lot of them have been removed or deleted!

You can copy the comment URLs, replace "reddit.com" with "removeddit.com" or "ceddit.com", and _then_ read the removed comments, but that'd take way too long and your legs are actually starting to hurt pretty bad now.

But wait! You just remembered you have [removed] installed on your phone!

Viewing removed comments is as easy as 1, 2, 3!
