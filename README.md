An Android app to quickly view [removed] or [deleted] comments on reddit.

~~__Click here to download the latest release.__~~ Temporarily disabled while I publish the app to the Play Store.

Special thanks to: 
* Jason Baumgartner for creating and maintaining pushshift.io, the ultimate reddit archive tool.
* Jesper Wrang for creating removeddit.com, a web app for viewing removed comments and posts.

When I'm browsing through reddit, I tend to come across [removed] and [deleted] comments pretty frequently. Sometimes those comments are removed for saying something controversial, earning a ton of downvotes and disapproving responses. Other times, a comment is removed by the /r/AskHistorians mods for not meeting subreddit guidelines.

Regardless of the reason, my curiosity demands seeing what that comment originally said. I started out by copying the comment URL, replacing "reddit.com" with "removeddit.com" or "ceddit.com," then viewing the unremoved comment in a browser. But that quickly became incredibly tedious to do every single time.

So, I figured I'd make an app that directly retrieves archived data from pushshift.io, the source removeddit and ceddit get their data from.

Introducing "[removed]," an app that quickly brings up a dialog displaying a removed comment's data.

Unremoving a comment now only takes a few simple steps:

__1. Share the comment__
